**In this project we focused retail analysis with Walmart data and answer the following questions:**
- Which store has maximum sales?
- Which store has maximum varying sales?
- Some holidays have a negative impact on sales. Find out holidays
that have higher sales than the mean sales in the non-holiday season
for all stores together.
- Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give
insights.
- Plot the relations between weekly sales vs. other numeric features
and give insights.
